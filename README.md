* Why React?
React is declarative
Painless iteration (can change your app little by little - it's only the V)

* Benefits of Components
Encapsulation (all functionality is specified right there in componenet)
Composabilty (can use it all over the place - DRY)

* Forms
e.target.elements.inputName.value.trim();
this.setState({val});
Add handler to the form tag. and use name='inputName' in the input tag
use this: this.setState(this.getInitialState());

* Things to check out

GraphQL
Rx.js (do something everytime user double-clicked but only 300ms in between)
